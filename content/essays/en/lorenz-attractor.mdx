The **Lorenz Attractor** is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, a system of three ordinary differential equations originally studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions.

## The Equations

The system is defined by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the Prandtl number
- $\rho$ is the Rayleigh number
- $\beta$ is a geometric factor

## Interactive Simulation

Below is a real-time simulation of the system. You can adjust the **Rayleigh number ($\rho$)** to observe the transition from a stable fixed point to a chaotic attractor.

## The Butterfly Effect

The shape of the Lorenz attractor, when plotted, may resemble a butterfly or figure eight. The system exhibits *sensitive dependence on initial conditions*, meaning that small changes in the starting state lead to vastly different trajectories over time. This is the essence of chaos.
